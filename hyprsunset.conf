# NOTE — TIMEZONE / UTC WORKAROUND
# hyprsunset is currently interpreting `time = HH:MM` as UTC.
# Buenos Aires is UTC-3 (no DST), so to trigger at a given LOCAL time,
# set the profile time to LOCAL + 3h.
# Example: Local 18:15 → set `time = 21:15`.
# Converted below from your local BA times:
#   07:30 → 10:30
#   18:15 → 21:15
#   22:30 → 01:30 (next day)
#   06:30 → 09:30
# If later you run hyprsunset with a proper TZ (e.g., TZ=America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires),
# revert these by subtracting 3 hours.

# Cap how bright gamma can go (100 = 100%)
max-gamma = 150

# Day (Buenos Aires typical morning start)
profile {
    time = 10:30         # was 07:30 local
    identity = true      # ignore temperature; neutral colors
    gamma = 1.00         # normal perceived brightness
}

# Night (Buenos Aires typical evening start)
profile {
    time = 21:15         # was 18:15 local
    temperature = 3700   # warmer color (lower K = warmer)
    gamma = 0.85         # dim slightly below monitor's min
}

# Late night (even warmer/dimmer; optional—delete if you want only 2 states)
profile {
    time = 01:30         # was 22:30 local (next day in UTC)
    temperature = 3400
    gamma = 0.80
}

# Pre-dawn ease-in (optional)
profile {
    time = 09:30         # was 06:30 local
    temperature = 4700
    gamma = 0.95
